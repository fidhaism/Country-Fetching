The HTML code provided is a template for a web page designed to display countries and their flags. It includes a title, "Fetch Countries & Flags," and sets up a responsive viewport. The CSS styles define the appearance of the country cards, ensuring they are displayed inline with consistent width, border, and shadow for a neat arrangement. The flags are set to scale correctly within these cards. The JavaScript file `main.js` is linked, which likely contains the logic to fetch and display the country data. The body of the HTML contains a header with the page title and a `div` with the id "result," where the country cards will be dynamically inserted by the JavaScript code. The commented-out sections suggest there was or will be a table layout option for additional country details. Overall, this code forms the foundation of a webpage that presents a list of countries with their flags in a structured and styled manner.
